# Traffic visulisation using TfL data
This project is a visual representation of the road incidents that occur in the past 5 days in London, using data from TfL and openFrameworks.

## Current stage
Currently the main visulisation object is drawn based on the number of incidents in the past 2 days. The object's layers are not yet colour coded. There is also no GUI.

## How to use
Click and drag to pan around the object, use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the object

## How to install
Place the ```traffic-visualisation``` folder within a folder called ```PAP``` in the apps directory within the open frameworks folder, therefore the path should be ```(openFrameworks folder) > apps > PAP > traffic-visulisation```
No addons are required.
*Note: It may take a few seconds for the application to launch, this is normal. Also an internet connection is required otherwise the program will crash, this is intentional*
